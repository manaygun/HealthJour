                                        <p>No matter your age or athletic ability, strength training is the key to flexibility, mobility, improved performance and lower injury risk. Anyone, at any fitness level, can and should strength train. And it doesn't have to take hours at the gym to see results. We’ll teach you the basics of strength training in the comfort of your own home. It’ll take only nine minutes of exertion to complete a full-body strength-building workout. Grab a towel and get ready to feel strong.</p>

                                                    <p>The following nine moves are strength training exercises that you may have seen before. Alone, they work a set group of muscles, but strung together in one-minute intervals, these nine exercises become a complete, whole-body workout.</p>
                                                    <p>We’ve broken down the nine exercises into three sets of three. Before you begin each set, set a timer (or work out near a watch with a second hand). If you are just starting to work out, do each exercise as hard as you can for one minute, followed by the next, until you complete the first set. Then, take a one-minute break before moving onto set 2, in which the exercises should also be performed for one minute each.</p>
                                                    <p>Ultimately, you’ll complete the whole workout, having completed nine minutes of training with two minutes of breaks in between.</p>
                                                    <p>Do this workout two to three times a week for maximum benefits.</p>

                                                        Done incorrectly, squats can be hard on your knees. As you squat, keep your butt pushed out, like you are about to sit on a chair. Use the muscles in your hips and thighs to push yourself up; don’t press your knees forward as you move. If you’re doing it correctly, your knees will move only during the first half of the squat; your hips will finish the movement.

Leg modifications can include putting the right leg into a 3 o’clock position and then bringing it back to center, then bringing the left leg to a 9 o’clock position and then bringing it back to center, and then doing a push-up. We call this the 3 o’clock 9 o’clock burpee.
