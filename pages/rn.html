     <p>An unhealthy lifestyle increases your risk for this and other chronic diseases that can lead to premature death. To investigate the effects of healthy habits on Americans' health and longevity, the Harvard T.H. They used other data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate the distribution of lifestyle choices and death rates across the U.S. population. The team collected data on five different low-risk lifestyle factors and compared the health outcomes of adopters and non-adopters for all five.Interesting results emerged. <strong><a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/healthy-habits-can-lengthen-life">Click to the link for full research!</a></strong>.

        <p>Dietary recommendations to limit red meat are based on observational studies linking intake to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk together with the potential of its saturated fatty acid (SFA) content to raise low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. However, the relation of white meat to CVD risk, and the effects of dietary protein source on lipoprotein particle subfractions, have not been extensively evaluated.<strong><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/110/1/24/5494812">Full research!</a></strong></p>

There is something to be said about the power of working out in a group — but what is it about exercising with others that motivates us?</p>

        <p>Health is an aspect of life that is essentially one of the important factors in basic human performance. Health contributes to general well-being and overall lifestyle. This study examined the perception of college students from Kuwait University about a healthy lifestyle and its effect on their health. A healthy lifestyle was measured by diet, exercise, and sleep. For the purpose of the study, a questionnaire was administered to the participants, which included 150 undergraduate college students from Kuwait University, who represented a range of ages, and gender. Computer data entry and analysis was done by using (SPSS).<strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743511000739">HERE!</a></strong></p>

        <p>Timing of obesity development during childhood and adolescence is unclear, hindering preventive strategies. The primary aim of the present study was to quantify the incidence of overweight and obesity throughout childhood and adolescence in a large contemporary cohort of English children (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC; children born 1991–1992). A secondary aim was to examine the persistence of overweight and obesity.

        <p>Sports injuries have increased today due to the rise in interest towards every branch of sports. Injuriescan occur in any part of the body. Sports injuries should highly be considered in terms of both the athletes’ futureand the medicine. This study aims to research shoulder injuries and treatment methods within the scope of upperextremity as a result of athlete injury, and accordingly to present the researchers’ incidence applications. Anatomicalstructure of the shoulder joint and its intense usage set ground for injury. Many conservative and surgical methodsexist for shoulder injuries. While some of these have become conventional (like physical therapy, and injections),some of them have become quite popular in recent years. In the researchers’ clinical application for 204 athletepatients they are treated for various shoulder problems, and the methods enabled the athlete patients to return tosports in a short time through the short-range fruitful surgical applications and physiotherapy methods supportedwith injection. In this study, the methods used for going back to sports in a short time are explained.<strong><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289186638_Research_on_Shoulder_Injuries_in_Athletes_and_Treatment_Methods">Full research!</a></strong></p>

        </p>
       <p>Increased salt intake is associated with increased risk of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and  brosis, cardiovascular events, renal stones, proteinuria, and renal failure. Increased sugar intake is directly linked to increased risk of obesity, fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. Also, increased sugar intake may be indirectly related to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Both salt and sugar intake is directly linked to increased systemic and hypothalamic in ammation, endothelial dysfunction, microangiopathy, cardiovascular remodelling, cancers, and death.</p>
       <p>There is no safe limit of sugar consumption, as the human body can produce its own glucose. Being nature’s gift to mankind, there is no harm in moderate consumption of salt and sugar, however, modest reduction in the consumption of both can substantially reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases.strong><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326715311_The_Twin_White_Herrings_Salt_and_Sugar">Full article!</strong></a></p>
